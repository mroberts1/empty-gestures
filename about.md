## Terminal Beach

Part diary, part logbook, part soapbox, this blog serves as a record of my everyday experience of screen-based networked communication technologies. 

The title is inspired by J.G. Ballard's classic short story collection [*The Terminal Beach*](http://www.fantasyliterature.com/reviews/the-terminal-beach/) (1964), although "terminal" here refers more to the computer terminal as the dominant screen interface of the digital age.
